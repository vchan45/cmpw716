            <h1>Future Plans</h1>
            <p>I made several possible plans for my future career after I finish my study in the Professional Writing program of Centennial College. My first plan is to take the Professional Writing program of Centennial College to gain the skill to write an outstanding piece of essay that will help me gain admission in a PhD program of Toronto Metropolitan University or University of Toronto. </p>
            <p>If I still could not gain accceptance into any PhD programs in the Greater Toronto Area, then I will take a Master program at one of the Universities in Toronto or Scarborough that requires a thesis writing to get the PhD qualification as my second plan. If I could not gain acceptance into the thesis option for the selected Master program, then I will take the Project Management program in Centennial College for my third plan.</p>
            <p>During the break between my academic studies or the end of my academic studies, I might volunteer for an organization to gain work experience.</p>
