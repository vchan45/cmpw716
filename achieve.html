            <p>Insightful advices for pastors of Toronto Christian Community Church (formerly Toronto Chinese Community Church) in 2012.</p>

            <p>In a University of Toronto course called "INF2210: Human Values in Data Science" during the Fall semester of 2020, I wrote an academic essay that discuss about the incentives for the development and distribution of artificially scarce goods. I mentioned the problems to use traditional Capitalist model to incentivizes production of artificially scarce goods like network effect and high fixed cost relative to variable cost. The solutions that I proposed include the use of alternative system of incentives like the open-source licensing in the development of Linux OS where developers gain incentives through consumption of the software that they produce and the ability to use improvement that other producer made to their software.</p>
            <p>In a university course called "INF1340: Programming for Data Science" during the Fall semester of 2019, I helped a team member learn how to perform computer coding for a machine learning assignment. My team member had expressed hopelessness in her attempts to create a computer code for her part of the assignment. I tried to understand what she needs to know to accomplish her tasks and then give her hints to help her understand the solutions to the computer coding problem. I used multiple channels of communications for different goals like text messaging to solve simple problems, email messaging to download a help sheet for computer programming, and voice messagning to quickly assist her before the assignment deadline. In the end, we submitted the assignment work in time and get a grade of A.</p>
